Hi! I am Luciano, a Ruby and React developer located in Fortaleza, Brazil. My goal with this blog is to share my experiences and possibly help others to learn something new.

Fell free to get in contact via [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/lutchobandeira) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucianobandeira).

See you and happy coding!
